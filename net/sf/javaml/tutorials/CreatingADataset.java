/**
 * This tutorial show how to create a {@link Dataset} from a collection of instances. This tutorial
 * assumes you know how to create an {@link Instance}. To create instances for this
 * tutorial we will use the method from {@link InstanceTools} to allows to create random
 * instances.
 * 
 * In this tutorial we will create a number of instances and group them in a
 * dataset.
 * 
 * Basically a dataset is a collection of instances.
