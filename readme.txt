The Java Machine Learning Library readme documentation. 

This document covers the basic documentation of the library. 

The Java Machine Learning Library is licensed under GNU-GPL.

More elaborate documentation can be found on the web site
http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/



1. Overview
=============
Java-ML in a nutshell:

    * A collection of machine learning algorithms
    * Common interface for each type of algorithms
    * Library aimed at software engineers and programmers, so no GUI, but clear interfaces
    * Reference implementations for algorithms described in the scientific literature.
    * Well documented source code.
    * Plenty of code samples and tutorials.



2. How to get started
=====================
When you are reading this, you most probably already downloaded the library. To use it, include the javaml-<version>.jar in your classpath.

Code samples can be found
here: http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/tutorials
or here: http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/src/tutorials/

3. Requirements
===============
The library is coded for Java 1.6+ so you will need a JDK that is at least
version 1.6+
