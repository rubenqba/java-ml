1. Overview
=============
The Java Machine Learning Library is a collection of machine learning and data
mining algorithms with accompanying documentation.

2. Dependencies
===============
* Jakarta commons-math
----------------------
The library requires the commons-math library of the Jakarta project which is 
bundled with the library.

* JUnit 4.0
-----------
For the SVN download you will also need JUnit 4.0 to compile the unit tests.

* JAMA 1.0.2
------------
Since version 0.0.10 we have incorporated the JAMA version 1.0.2 into the library.

* AJT
-----
Since version 0.0.14 the AJT library is required. This library is supplied with Java-ML

* LibSVM
---------
LibSVM 2.85 is integrated in the library

* Third party libraries needed to build
---------------------------------------
If you want the project yourself, you need several libraries that are required by the build script.
They can all be found in the devtools/lib directory when checking out the project from the SVN.

3. Requirements
===============
The library is coded for Java 1.5+ so you will need a JDK that is at least
version 1.5+
