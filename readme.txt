The Java Machine Learning Library readme documentation. 

This document covers the very basic documentation of the library. 

The Java Machine Learning Library is licensed under GNU-GPL.

More elaborate documentation can be found on the web site
http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/

1. Overview
=============
Java-ML in a nutshell:

    * A collection of machine learning algorithms
    * Common interface for each type of algorithms
    * Library aimed at software engineers and programmers, so no GUI, but clear interfaces
    * Reference implementations for algorithms described in the scientific literature.
    * Well documented source code.
    * Plenty of code samples and tutorials.

2. How to get started
=====================
When you are reading this, you most probably already downloaded the library. 
To use it, include the javaml-<version>.jar in your classpath, as well as the 
jars that are available in lib/.  

How to get started, code samples, tutorials on various tasks can be found
at http://java-ml.sourceforge.net

3. Requirements
===============
Version for JDK 1.5 and 1.6 are available. The source is originally written for 
1.6, and backported for each release to 1.5.

Version 1.5 is available since release 0.1.3

4. Dependencies
===============
Required libraries:
- Apache Commons Math: use in some algorithms, version 1.1 is included
- Abeel Java Toolkit: used in some classes, version 1.20 is included

Optional libraries:
- Weka: if you like to use algorithms from Weka. Weka 3.6.0 is included in the distribution
- JUnit: if you want to run the unit tests. JUnit 3.4.1 is included in the distribution.
Unit tests are only available from the SVN!
